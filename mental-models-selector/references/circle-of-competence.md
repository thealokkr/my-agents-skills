### Guidelines to Apply Circle of Competence Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Principle
A circle of competence defines the boundaries of what you truly understand versus what you don't. Playing within your circle gives you an edge; playing outside invites mistakes.

#### 2. Identify Your Circle
Map your genuine expertise:

- **Core Knowledge**: What do you deeply understand through experience and study?
- **Skills & Abilities**: What can you execute well under various conditions?
- **Experience Base**: What problems have you solved repeatedly?
- **Honest Gaps**: What areas are you weak in despite thinking otherwise?

#### 3. Mark the Boundaries
Define the edge of your competence:

- **Known Competencies**: Clear strengths you can leverage
- **Known Gaps**: Obvious areas of weakness to avoid or delegate
- **Unknown Unknowns**: Areas where inexperience creates blind spots
- **Honest Assessment**: Distinguish between confidence and capability

#### 4. Operate Within Your Circle
Strategic deployment of your advantages:

- **Play Where You Have an Edge**: Focus energy on domains where you can consistently outperform
- **Protect Against Overconfidence**: Resist expanding your circle beyond reality
- **Know When to Leave**: Recognize when a decision requires expertise outside your circle
- **Respect Others' Circles**: Seek expertise from those in their domain

#### 5. Expand Your Circle Carefully
Growth happens at the margins:

- **Study Deliberately**: Build knowledge in adjacent areas with intentionality
- **Apprenticeship**: Learn directly from masters in new domains
- **Feedback Loops**: Test your expanding circle and adjust based on results
- **Accept Slow Growth**: Expanding competence takes time and humility

#### 6. Key Questions to Ask
- "Am I truly an expert in this, or do I just think I am?"
- "What would a genuine expert in this domain say about my assessment?"
- "Where am I most likely to be blindsided by my confidence?"
- "Who should I consult before making decisions outside my circle?"
