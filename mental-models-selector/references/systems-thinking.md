### Guidelines to Apply Systems Thinking Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Principle
Systems thinking views an organization or problem as an interconnected whole rather than isolated parts. Changes in one area ripple through the system, and simple solutions often create unintended consequences.

#### 2. Recognize System Components
Map the key elements:

- **Elements**: Individual components (people, things, information)
- **Interconnections**: How elements relate and influence each other
- **Purpose**: The intended and actual goal of the system
- **Boundaries**: What's included; what's outside the system
- **Environment**: External forces that affect the system

#### 3. Identify System Characteristics
Understand what makes it a system:

- **Interdependence**: Changing one part affects others
- **Feedback Loops**: Results feed back and influence future actions
- **Delays**: Time between action and consequence
- **Non-Linearity**: Small changes can have large effects; large efforts may have small effects
- **Emergence**: System behavior differs from component behavior
- **Adaptation**: System responds and changes based on experience

#### 4. Diagnose System Problems
Look beyond surface symptoms:

- **Identify Leverage Points**: Where do small changes have large effects?
- **Trace Feedback**: Follow how outcomes influence future inputs
- **Examine Delays**: Where does lag between action and feedback cause problems?
- **Map Incentives**: How do system incentives drive behavior?
- **Question Boundaries**: Do system boundaries capture the real problem?
- **Understand Purpose**: Is the system designed for what it's actually accomplishing?

#### 5. Design System Changes
- **Address Root Causes**: Rather than symptoms
- **Consider Ripple Effects**: What will change when you modify one element?
- **Align Incentives**: Make the behavior you want most profitable
- **Reduce Delays**: Faster feedback enables faster course correction
- **Simplify Where Possible**: But don't oversimplify
- **Test Changes**: Small pilots before full implementation

#### 5b. Counterfactual Thinking: What Are We NOT Seeing?
- "If we removed that element entirely, what would we discover?"
- "What happens if we invert the current system incentives?"
- "What patterns would we see if we looked at this system from the opposite perspective?"
- "What would the system look like without the constraints we assume are fixed?"
- *Purpose*: Reveals hidden assumptions and invisible system structures that constrain thinking.

#### 6. Strategic Questions
- "What is the actual purpose of this system based on its results?"
- "Where are the key leverage points?"
- "What feedback loops are driving current behavior?"
- "How might our solution create unintended consequences?"
- "Are we treating a symptom when we should treat the root cause?"
