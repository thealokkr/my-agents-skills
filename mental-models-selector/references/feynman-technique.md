### Guidelines to Apply Feynman Technique Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Approach
Teach a concept to a 12-year-old (or someone unfamiliar with it) to identify gaps in your understanding. When you can't explain something simply, you've found where your knowledge is incomplete.

#### 2. Step 1: Choose and Study the Concept
- Select a concept you want to master
- Study it thoroughly from multiple sources
- Gather examples, applications, and nuances
- Take notes focusing on key ideas

#### 3. Step 2: Explain to a Beginner
Now teach it as if to a 12-year-old or complete novice:

- **Use Simple Language**: Avoid jargon; define technical terms
- **Use Analogies**: Compare to familiar concepts
- **Use Examples**: Concrete instances beats abstract explanations
- **Avoid Memorized Language**: Explain in your own words, not textbook language
- **Make It Engaging**: Keep attention with relevant context

#### 4. Step 3: Identify Gaps
As you explain, notice what you can't easily convey:

- **Where do you stumble?** This indicates incomplete understanding
- **What requires memorization?** True understanding doesn't depend on rote memory
- **What needs qualification?** Exceptions suggest deeper complexity
- **What can't you simplify further?** This might be irreducible core knowledge or your gap

#### 5. Step 4: Refine and Loop Back
Improve your understanding:

- **Review Sources**: Go back to materials to deepen understanding in gap areas
- **Simplify Further**: Break complex concepts into smaller building blocks
- **Test Your Understanding**: Explain again to see if gaps are filled
- **Connect to Other Knowledge**: Link to what you already understand

#### 6. Benefits and Applications
- **Deep Learning**: Ensures you understand, not just memorize
- **Teaching Others**: Prepare yourself to explain effectively
- **Communication**: Develop clarity even for complex topics
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Reveal where continued study is needed
- **Problem-Solving**: Deep understanding generates better solutions
