### Guidelines to Apply Occam's Razor Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Principle
Occam's Razor: The simplest explanation with the fewest assumptions is more likely to be correct than a complex one with many moving parts.

This doesn't mean simple is always true—just that unnecessary complexity should be eliminated.

#### 2. Apply the Principle
When evaluating ideas or solutions:

- **List Competing Explanations**: What are the rival theories or approaches?
- **Count Assumptions**: How many beliefs must be true for each explanation?
- **Identify Unnecessary Complexity**: Which elements don't add explanatory power?
- **Prefer the Simpler**: Default to the explanation requiring fewer assumptions

#### 3. Reduce Complexity Strategically
- **Remove Redundant Elements**: Do all components serve a purpose?
- **Eliminate Assumptions**: Which beliefs can I drop without affecting the outcome?
- **Streamline Language**: Can I explain this in fewer words without losing meaning?
- **Question Additions**: Before adding complexity, ask "Is this necessary?"

#### 4. Avoid Common Traps
- **Don't Over-Simplify**: Some problems genuinely require complex solutions
- **Acknowledge Exceptions**: Rare cases may require additional assumptions
- **Distinguish Simplicity from Superficiality**: Surface-level explanations miss important nuances
- **Context Matters**: What's simple in one domain may be incomplete in another

#### 5. Test for False Simplicity
- "Does this explanation predict all observed phenomena?"
- "Are there cases where this breaks down?"
- "Am I trading accuracy for simplicity?"
- "What am I missing by oversimplifying?"

#### 6. Use in Decision-Making
- **Choose Simple Solutions**: When multiple approaches work, pick the one requiring fewest resources
- **Design Systems**: Build with minimal necessary components
- **Communicate Clearly**: Explain complex ideas simply without sacrificing accuracy
