### Guidelines to Apply Commitment & Consistency Bias Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Principle
Commitment & Consistency Bias: The psychological pressure to stay consistent with prior public commitments, even when proven wrong. Once you've publicly taken a position, changing it feels like admitting failure.

#### 2. How it Works
The mechanism:

- **Public Commitment**: Once you've publicly stated a position, changing it carries social cost
- **Identity Fusion**: Positions become tied to identity ("I'm the X person")
- **Sunk Cost**: Emotional investment in being "right" about a position
- **Cognitive Dissonance**: Discomfort acknowledging contradiction between belief and evidence
- **Face Saving**: Admitting error feels like losing credibility
- **Escalation**: Doubling down to prove original position was correct

#### 3. Where it Causes Problems
- **Strategy Persistence**: Companies stick with failing strategy to avoid admitting error
- **Hiring Mistakes**: Once you've promoted someone, hard to admit it was wrong
- **Market Timing**: Once you've proclaimed a market will boom, hard to change
- **Public Positions**: Political/ideological positions become hardened
- **Investment Errors**: Holding losing positions to avoid crystallizing loss
- **Relationship Patterns**: Maintaining patterns even when acknowledged as problematic

#### 4. The Escalation Trap
Commitment leads to compounding errors:

- **Initial Commitment**: Public position on direction/person/approach
- **Challenge to Commitment**: Evidence suggests position is wrong
- **Doubling Down**: Increase investment to prove position was right
- **Escalation**: More resources committed, making reversal more costly
- **Terminal Position**: By then, reversing costs even more, so never happens

#### 5. Overcome Commitment Bias
- **Low-Key Commitments**: Avoid loud public pronouncements
- **Trial Periods**: Frame decisions as experiments, not permanent commitments
- **Sequential Decisions**: Make smaller commitments first
- **Graceful Exit**: Provide ways to change without loss of face
- **Reframe Changes**: "We learned and adapted" rather than "we were wrong"
- **Culture of Flexibility**: Make adaptation valued, not penalized

#### 6. Organizational Applications
- **Decision Making**: Surface disagreement before decisions harden
- **Channel Decisions**: Make channels for changing direction without reputation loss
- **Psychological Safety**: Make it safe to admit error
- **Reviews**: Schedule regular reviews where changes are expected
- **Attribution**: Shift from "person was wrong" to "situation changed"

#### 7. Strategic Questions
- "Are we staying with this position due to evidence or due to past commitment?"
- "What signals would lead us to change course?"
- "How can we make it psychologically safe to reverse this decision?"
- "Is our consistency helping or hurting us?"
- "Are we escalating commitment to save face rather than cut losses?"
