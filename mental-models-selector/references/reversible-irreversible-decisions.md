### Guidelines to Apply Reversible vs. Irreversible Decisions Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Principle
Classifying decisions as "One-Way Door" (irreversible) or "Two-Way Door" (reversible) to determine appropriate speed and deliberation. Different decision types warrant different decision processes.

#### 2. One-Way Door Decisions
Irreversible or hard to reverse:

**Characteristics**
- High switching costs
- Past investments can't be recovered
- Difficult to undo consequences
- Long time horizons make reversal unlikely
- Impacts difficult to undo

**Examples**
- Hiring senior leaders
- Entering new markets
- Selling businesses or assets
- Major capital investments
- Organizational structure changes
- Long-term partnerships/contracts

**Decision Process**
- Take time; deliberate carefully
- Involve many perspectives
- Conduct thorough analysis
- Plan contingencies
- Get consensus from key stakeholders
- Move slowly, gather information

#### 3. Two-Way Door Decisions
Reversible with low switching costs:

**Characteristics**
- Easy/cheap to reverse
- Information improves with experience
- Consequences are recoverable
- Time pressure is lower
- Learning value from trying

**Examples**
- Trying new tools or processes
- Small pilot projects
- Hiring junior people
- Trying new pricing
- Test campaigns
- Operational experiments

**Decision Process**
- Decide quickly; move fast
- Don't overanalyze
- Get roughly right input, then decide
- Give people authority to decide
- Learn by doing
- Fail fast and recover quickly

#### 4. The Reversibility Framework
Applying the model:

**Step 1: Classify**
- Is this a one-way or two-way door?
- When can we revisit this decision?
- What's the cost of reversal?

**Step 2: Analyze Asymmetries**
- Is it reversible for us but not for others?
- Where's the point of no return?
- What decisions could create irreversibility?

**Step 3: Choose Process**
- If one-way: slow, deliberate, consensus
- If two-way: fast, decentralized, experimental
- If uncertain: treat as one-way to be safe

#### 5. Watch for Hidden One-Way Doors
Some appear two-way but aren't:

- **Reputational Harm**: Can't reverse damage to brand/relationships
- **Cultural Impact**: Culture changes become sticky even when decisions reverse
- **Market Position**: Losing market share hard to regain
- **Talent Migration**: Once top talent leaves, hard to get back
- **Strategic Position**: Some moves close off future options
- **Competitive Response**: Opponent reactions create cascade effects

#### 6. Common Mistakes
- **Treating One-Way as Two-Way**: Moving fast on irreversible decisions
- **Treating Two-Way as One-Way**: Over-deliberating easily reversible decisions
- **Asymmetric Reversibility**: Decision easy for us to reverse, hard for others
- **Hidden Irreversibility**: Not recognizing what can't actually be reversed
- **Reversibility Decay**: Decisions reversible now, irreversible later

#### 7. Strategic Questions
- "Is this decision a one-way or two-way door?"
- "When does reversibility disappear (what's the decision point)?"
- "Are we applying the right decision process for the reversibility?"
- "What appears reversible but actually isn't?"
- "Who else is affected by this decision and what's their reversibility?"
