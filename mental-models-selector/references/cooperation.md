### Guidelines to Apply Cooperation Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Principle
Cooperation is interaction where organisms, groups, or individuals assist each other for mutual benefit. It can be an evolutionary force driving survival, or a strategic choice for mutual gain.

#### 2. The Conditions for Cooperation
When and why cooperation emerges:

- **Mutual Benefit**: Both parties gain more by cooperating than competing
- **Repeat Interactions**: Long-term relationships encourage cooperation
- **Reputation**: Cooperative behavior is rewarded; defection is punished
- **Shared Values**: Cooperative culture makes cooperation the default
- **Aligned Incentives**: Structure makes cooperation profitable
- **Transparency**: Clear understanding of actions and results

#### 3. Prisoner's Dilemma Context
Understanding why cooperation is hard:

- **Incentive Misalignment**: Short-term gain from defection vs. long-term benefit of cooperation
- **Trust Risk**: Fear of being exploited if you cooperate with a defector
- **Defection Temptation**: When others cooperate, defection is most profitable
- **First-Mover Risk**: Who cooperates first when cooperation requires vulnerability?
- **Enforcement**: Without enforcement, cooperation can unravel

#### 4. Enable Cooperation
Design systems that encourage cooperation:

- **Align Incentives**: Structure rewards to make cooperation most profitable
- **Repeat Games**: Build long-term relationships where reputation matters
- **Transparency**: Make actions and results visible
- **Enforcement**: Punish defection; reward cooperation
- **Culture**: Build shared values that make cooperation default
- **Trust Building**: Start small and verify reliability
- **Lead with Cooperation**: Sometimes initiating cooperation can trigger reciprocation

#### 5. Organizational Applications
- **Team Design**: Structure to make cooperation more profitable than competition
- **Compensation**: Align individual incentives with team outcomes
- **Transparency**: Share information so people understand interdependencies
- **Relationship Building**: Invest in relationships that extend beyond single transactions
- **Culture Reinforcement**: Celebrate and reward cooperation; address defection quickly

#### 6. Strategic Questions
- "Are our incentive structures promoting cooperation or creating competition?"
- "Who might be tempted to defect, and why?"
- "How can we build reputation and relationships to encourage cooperation?"
- "What transparency would help show the benefits of cooperation?"
- "Where do we have poor cooperation and how can we restructure for better alignment?"
