### Guidelines to Apply Churn Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Principle
Churn is the periodic loss and replacement of components—customers, employees, inventory, or ideas. Every system experiences some level of churn; understanding it reveals health and sustainability.

#### 2. Measure Churn
Track the rate of loss and replacement:

- **Customer Churn**: What % of customers leave each period?
- **Employee Turnover**: What % of workforce departs annually?
- **Inventory Turnover**: How quickly is stock replaced?
- **Idea Evolution**: How many ideas are generated and discarded?
- **Market Churn**: How many competitors enter and exit?
- **Portfolio Churn**: How often does product mix change?

#### 3. Interpret Churn Rates
What different rates mean:

- **Low Churn**: Stability, retention, but can indicate stagnation
- **Moderate Churn**: Healthy renewal, space for new people/ideas
- **High Churn**: Loss of institutional knowledge, instability
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Churn expected in certain cycles
- **Concerning Directions**: Rising churn in key areas is warning sign

#### 4. The Cost of Churn
Understand the impact:

- **Knowledge Loss**: When people leave, knowledge walks out
- **Efficiency Loss**: Onboarding new people/rebuilding takes time
- **Relationship Loss**: Customer and supplier relationships don't transfer
- **Cultural Impact**: High churn weakens culture
- **Investment Loss**: Training and development lost
- **Hidden Costs**: Quality issues, error rates increase during transition

#### 5. Manage Churn Strategically
- **Retention Focus**: Invest to retain high-value components
- **Replacement Ready**: Develop talent pipeline before need
- **Knowledge Capture**: Document what's critical before it walks away
- **Transition Planning**: Reduce churn impact through overlaps and handoffs
- **Selection Timing**: Sometimes churn is opportunity to upgrade quality
- **Gradual Rotation**: Controlled renewal better than sudden loss

#### 6. Strategic Questions
- "Is our churn rate healthy or problematic?"
- "What's driving churn in critical areas?"
- "Are we prepared for the churn we're experiencing?"
- "How much does our churn cost in knowledge and efficiency loss?"
- "Should we be accepting more churn to refresh or less to stabilize?"
