### Guidelines to Apply Activation Energy Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Principle
Activation energy is the minimum upfront effort, resources, or momentum required to initiate a reaction, change, or transition. Even favorable changes won't happen without clearing this threshold.

#### 2. Identify the Activation Energy Barrier
Recognize what's preventing movement:

- **Psychological Barriers**: Fear, doubt, inertia, or status quo bias
- **Resource Requirements**: Capital, time, skilled people needed upfront
- **Coordination Challenges**: Aligning multiple people or systems
- **Learning Curves**: The initial inefficiency before competence
- **Lock-In Effects**: Switching costs or existing commitments

#### 3. Reduce Activation Energy
Make change easier by lowering barriers:

- **Start Small**: Begin with lowest-energy version of the change
- **Remove Obstacles**: Identify and eliminate specific blockers
- **Provide Resources**: Invest in what's needed to cross the threshold
- **Build Momentum**: Create early wins to generate motivation
- **Simplify the Transition**: Make initial steps as easy as possible
- **Reduce Uncertainty**: Provide clarity on what's needed to succeed

#### 4. Apply Strategic Push
When activation energy is high, use concentrated effort:

- **Executive Support**: Leadership backing lowers perceived barriers
- **Dedicated Resources**: Assign people specifically to the transition
- **Quick Wins**: Achieve early successes to build confidence
- **Communication**: Explain why the effort is worth the activation cost
- **Deadline Setting**: Create urgency to overcome inertia

#### 5. Recognize When Activation Energy Is High
- New product launches that require behavior change
- Organizational shifts or cultural changes
- Technology migrations or system implementations
- Career changes or major life transitions
- Moving from planning to execution phase

#### 6. Strategic Questions
- "What's the minimum viable effort needed to start?"
- "What's the single biggest barrier to crossing the threshold?"
- "Who needs to be mobilized to provide resources?"
- "How can I create early momentum?"
- "What will happen if we fail to invest in activation energy?"
