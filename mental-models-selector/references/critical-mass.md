### Guidelines to Apply Critical Mass Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Principle
Critical mass is the point where enough material, effort, or momentum builds up for a system to jump discretely from one state to another. Small incremental changes suddenly cascade into transformation.

#### 2. Recognize Critical Mass Phenomena
Identify where thresholds exist:

- **Adoption Tipping Points**: When a certain % of population adopts something, it becomes mainstream
- **Resource Accumulation**: Building up reserves until you can make a major move
- **Momentum**: After enough small wins, transformation accelerates
- **Network Effects**: As users reach critical number, network becomes valuable
- **Market Shifts**: When enough players change, market dynamics shift suddenly
- **Cultural Change**: Minority view becomes majority through gradual acceptance

#### 3. Characteristics of Critical Mass Systems
- **Threshold**: There's a point of no return
- **Nonlinear Change**: Slow progress, then sudden acceleration
- **Irreversibility**: Once crossed, often can't go back
- **Winner-Take-Most**: Often creates extreme concentration
- **Path Dependency**: Which solution reaches critical mass first often wins
- **Timing**: Small differences in timing can determine winners

#### 4. Build Toward Critical Mass
Strategy for reaching the threshold:

- **Identify the Number**: What's the critical mass for your domain?
- **Early Adopters**: Start with those most predisposed to change
- **Network Effects**: Structure so value multiplies as you add users
- **Momentum**: Use early wins to attract larger waves
- **Triggers**: Identify what will tip the system (price point, feature, social proof)
- **Protect at Threshold**: Critical mass vulnerable to disruption right before tipping

#### 5. Defend Against Reaching Critical Mass
If an opponent is approaching critical mass:

- **Interdict Early**: Attack before they reach the threshold
- **Create Friction**: Add costs or difficulty to their growth
- **Offer Alternative**: Provide your own attractive option
- **Network Effects Protection**: Lock in your users before they abandon you
- **Move Fast**: Don't wait for your opponent to solidify their position

#### 6. Strategic Questions
- "What's the critical mass number for this market/idea/movement?"
- "How close are we to reaching it?"
- "What will dramatically accelerate us past the threshold?"
- "Can we reach critical mass with available resources?"
- "How can we defend our current position from challengers approaching critical mass?"
