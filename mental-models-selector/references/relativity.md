### Guidelines to Apply Relativity Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Principle
Relativity: Perceptions and judgments are shaped by unique vantage points and frames of reference. Absolute values are less important than relative values—what matters is contrast and perspective.

#### 2. How Relativity Works
The mechanism:

- **Reference Point**: Judgment is based on a starting point, not absolute value
- **Contrast Effect**: Perception of value changes based on what you compare it to
- **Context Dependency**: Same stimulus feels different in different contexts
- **Anchor Effect**: First information (anchor) disproportionately influences subsequent judgment
- **Frame Dependency**: How something is presented changes interpretation
- **Perspective Variance**: Different vantage points see different realities

#### 3. Classic Examples
- **Pricing**: $100 item seems expensive if you expected $50, cheap if you expected $200
- **Performance**: Employee seems talented compared to poor performers, average compared to stars
- **Compensation**: Your salary feels unfair when you learn peer makes 20% more
- **Status**: You feel successful relative to yesterday, unsuccessful relative to your goals
- **Size**: Problem feels enormous when you focus on it, manageable when you zoom out

#### 4. Apply Relativity to Advantage
- **Frame Appropriately**: Set reference frame to make your position look good
- **Control Comparisons**: Choose comparisons that favor your position
- **Set Anchors**: First offer/information disproportionately influences negotiation
- **Timing**: Present information when audiences are anchored to favorable contexts
- **Contrast Effects**: Surround preferred option with less attractive alternatives
- **Perspective Shifts**: Help others see from favorable perspective

#### 5. Resist Manipulation by Relativity
- **Absolute Benchmarks**: Compare to objective standards, not relative comparisons
- **Multiple Frames**: View situation from different reference points
- **Historical Context**: Compare to past, not just recent
- **External Standards**: Use industry benchmarks, not arbitrary comparisons
- **Anchor Awareness**: Recognize first number's influence on negotiation
- **Diverse Perspectives**: Get views from different vantage points

#### 6. Organizational Applications
- **Compensation**: How you present relative to others matters greatly
- **Performance Review**: Comparison to self, team, or peers drives perception
- **Pricing**: Customers judge value relative to alternatives and anchors
- **Negotiation**: First offer heavily influences final outcome
- **Status & Recognition**: What people notice relates to contrast with context

#### 7. Strategic Questions
- "What reference frame am I using, and is it appropriate?"
- "How would this look from a different perspective?"
- "What comparisons are driving my judgment?"
- "How could I reframe this to change perception?"
- "Am I anchored to unfavorable reference points?"
