### Guidelines to Apply Creative Destruction Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Principle
Creative Destruction is the capitalistic process where innovation destroys old ideas, products, and business models to replace them with newer ones. Destruction of incumbents creates space for new innovations.

#### 2. Recognize Creative Destruction
Identify where it's happening:

- **Market Disruption**: New technologies make old ones obsolete (digital replacing film)
- **Company Cycles**: Successful companies eventually decline and are replaced
- **Business Model Evolution**: How companies make money changes fundamentally
- **Job Transformation**: Work changes as technology advances
- **Industry Consolidation**: Weak players eliminated by stronger ones
- **Customer Behavior**: Preferences shift and force business transformation

#### 3. Embrace Creative Destruction
Position for renewal:

- **Don't Defend the Old**: Clinging to past advantages guarantees decline
- **Recreate Yourself**: Successful companies periodically reinvent core business
- **Invest in New**: Don't wait for old to die; build replacement before crisis
- **Cannibaliz Early**: If new will destroy old, better you do it than competitor
- **Lead the Transition**: Companies that manage their own destruction succeed
- **Remove Zombies**: Let struggling parts die to free resources for growth

#### 4. Psychological Barriers to Embracing Creative Destruction
- **Sunk Costs**: "We invested so much in this approach"
- **Identity**: "This is what we do" makes change feel existential
- **Success Trap**: Current success blinds to changing market
- **Institutional Inertia**: Bureaucracy slows destructive change
- **Fear of Disruption**: Safer to milk current model than risk on new
- **Short-Term Pressure**: Quarterly earnings focus discourages long-term reinvention

#### 5. Manage Creative Destruction
- **Signal Early**: Recognize when destruction is coming
- **Separate New from Old**: Don't let old business kill new innovations
- **Tolerate Disruption**: Accept short-term chaos from transition
- **Invest Ahead**: Fund new before old is exhausted
- **Leadership Continuity**: Sometimes new leadership better manages destruction
- **Portfolio Approach**: Multiple small bets on what comes next

#### 6. Strategic Questions
- "What's the next thing that could destroy our business?"
- "Should we be destroying any of our current products or services?"
- "Is our company defending the past or building the future?"
- "Where should we be cannibalizing our own offerings?"
- "How do we create space for creative destruction while maintaining current business?"
