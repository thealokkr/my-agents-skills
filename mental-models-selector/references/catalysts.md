### Guidelines to Apply Catalysts Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Principle
A catalyst is a substance or force that accelerates a reaction without being consumed by it. Catalysts are the "accelerants" of change—they speed up what would happen anyway, without being depleted.

#### 2. Identify Catalysts in Your Domain
Look for forces that accelerate progress:

- **People Catalysts**: Leaders or influencers who accelerate organizational change
- **Ideas Catalysts**: Key insights that unlock new possibilities
- **Technology Catalysts**: Tools that enable new ways of working
- **Event Catalysts**: Crises or moments that accelerate decisions
- **Incentive Catalysts**: Rewards that motivate faster action
- **Relationship Catalysts**: Connections that open doors and opportunities

#### 3. Recognize What Catalysts Do
- **Accelerate Natural Trends**: They speed up changes that are already needed
- **Lower Activation Energy**: They make change easier to initiate
- **Remain Unchanged**: The catalyst isn't consumed by enabling change
- **Work with Existing Forces**: They amplify drivers that are already present
- **Enable, Don't Create**: They don't make something happen that wouldn't eventually; they speed it up

#### 4. Deploy Catalysts Strategically
- **Identify Bottlenecks**: Where is progress slowed?
- **Find the Right Match**: The catalyst must fit the situation
- **Activate at Scale**: Small catalysts can have large effects
- **Combine Catalysts**: Multiple catalysts can compound effects
- **Remove Anti-Catalysts**: Eliminate what's slowing change

#### 5. Examples in Different Contexts
- **Organizations**: A new executive can catalyze cultural change
- **Projects**: A deadline can catalyze focused execution
- **Learning**: A great teacher can catalyze understanding
- **Innovation**: A small prototype can catalyze investment
- **Relationships**: An introduction can catalyze collaboration

#### 6. Strategic Questions
- "What's slowing progress toward our goal?"
- "What catalyst would accelerate this naturally occurring change?"
- "Who or what can amplify the momentum without being depleted?"
- "How can we create the conditions where catalysts work effectively?"
- "What anti-catalysts should we remove?"
