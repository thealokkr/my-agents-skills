### Guidelines to Apply Niches Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Principle
Niches: Specialized roles where an organism (company, product, skill) can thrive with reduced competition. Occupying a niche with less direct competition allows success with lower resources.

#### 2. Niche Characteristics
What defines a niche:

- **Specialized Focus**: Designed for specific customer/use case rather than broad market
- **Reduced Competition**: Fewer direct competitors vs. broad market
- **Unique Requirements**: Customer needs specific characteristics that broad solutions don't address
- **Higher Margins**: Less price competition in specialized markets
- **Customer Lock-in**: Switching cost higher; customers sticky
- **Defensibility**: Hard for broad players to compete effectively in niche
- **Resource Efficiency**: Can win with fewer resources by concentrating on specific segment

#### 3. Types of Niches
Different niche strategies:

- **Vertical Niches**: Deep focus on one industry (e.g., healthcare software)
- **Demographic Niches**: Focus on specific user group (e.g., women entrepreneurs)
- **Geographic Niches**: Focus on specific region (e.g., local service provider)
- **Use-Case Niches**: Focus on specific application (e.g., document automation)
- **Quality Niches**: High-end/luxury segment
- **Price Niches**: Low-cost segment
- **Feature Niches**: Specific technical capabilities

#### 4. Strategy Within a Niche
- **Go Deep**: Be best-in-class for niche requirements vs. broad competence
- **Network Effects**: Create community within niche
- **Integration**: Integrate deeply with niche workflows
- **Authority**: Establish thought leadership and credibility in niche
- **Partnerships**: Ally with others serving the niche
- **Expansion Readiness**: Build platform that can expand beyond niche if successful

#### 5. Niche Risks & Limitations
- **Market Size**: Niche may be too small for profitability
- **Niche Collapse**: If niche disappears, business dies
- **Niche Isolation**: Hard to expand beyond niche without losing focus
- **Aggregation**: Generalists may eventually serve niche better
- **Niche Invasion**: Competitors may move into attractive niche
- **Customer Concentration**: Few customers; losing one is significant impact

#### 6. Expand From Niche
When and how to go broader:

- **Platform Approach**: Build underlying platform that enables broader use
- **Adjacent Niches**: Expand to related niches naturally
- **Horizontal Expansion**: Expand to same customer serving different need
- **Vertical Expansion**: Expand to different customer with same solution
- **Timing**: Expand before niche saturates
- **Preparation**: Maintain niche identity while building broader capability

#### 7. Strategic Questions
- "What niche is our product ideally suited for?"
- "Can we dominate this niche better than broad competitors?"
- "Is this niche large enough to build a sustainable business?"
- "What would make this niche less attractive?"
- "When and how should we expand beyond the niche?"
