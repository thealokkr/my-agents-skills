### Guidelines to Apply Feedback Loops Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Principle
Feedback loops are mechanisms where outputs are routed back as inputs, creating reinforcing (positive) or stabilizing (negative) cycles that compound over time.

- **Negative Feedback**: Output reduces further change (thermostat that maintains temperature)
- **Positive Feedback**: Output amplifies further change (successful investment generating returns that fund bigger investments)

#### 2. Identify Feedback Loops in Your System
Map what feeds back and how:

- **Reinforcing Cycles**: Where does success breed success? Where does failure breed failure?
- **Stabilizing Cycles**: What mechanisms keep things in equilibrium?
- **Time Delays**: How long between action and feedback? (Delay increases instability)
- **Strength**: How much does the feedback amplify or dampen the original change?

#### 3. Common Feedback Loops in Organizations
- **Success Loop**: Confidence → better decisions → success → more confidence
- **Failure Loop**: Failure → loss of confidence → poor decisions → more failure
- **Growth Loop**: Revenue growth → investment in capability → better service → more revenue
- **Decline Loop**: Loss of talent → quality suffers → customers leave → fewer resources for retention
- **Market Loop**: Market share → pricing power → profitability → investment → more share

#### 4. Design Positive Feedback Loops
Create virtuous cycles:

- **Align Incentives**: Reward behaviors that compound over time
- **Quick Feedback**: Faster iteration enables quicker course correction
- **Visibility**: Make metrics visible so teams see cause and effect
- **Compound Effects**: Structure so early wins create momentum for bigger wins
- **Feedback Delay**: Minimize time between action and feedback

#### 4b. Measurement Framework
How to quantify loop strength:

- **Amplification Factor**: Measure output vs. input per cycle. If £1 invested generates £1.10 return, amplification factor is 1.1x. Compound this over cycles to see exponential growth.
- **Cycle Time**: How long between action and measurable feedback? Faster feedback = tighter control = more effective loop.
- **Loop Lag**: The delay between action and visible consequence. Long lags (>6 months) create instability; short lags (<2 weeks) create stable loops.
- **Threshold Detection**: At what point does amplification become too strong and destabilize? Identify your safe operating range.
- **Failure Cascade Time**: If the loop reverses (goes negative), how long until collapse? Shorter time = more fragile system.

#### 5. Control Negative Feedback
Prevent or manage destructive cycles:

- **Circuit Breakers**: When things fail, stop their amplification (pause hiring, reduce spending)
- **Monitoring**: Detect destructive cycles early
- **Intervention Points**: Interrupt the loop before it becomes terminal
- **Stabilizers**: Build mechanisms that limit damage
- **Recovery Paths**: Design ways to restart positive loops

#### 5b. Counterfactual Thinking: What If This Loop Didn't Exist?
- "If this positive feedback loop stopped tomorrow, what would collapse?"
- "What assumptions about this loop's stability have we never tested?"
- "What conditions would flip this positive loop to negative?"
- "How would we recover if this amplification loop broke?"
- *Purpose*: Forces you to identify fragilities hidden by apparent momentum.

#### 6. Limits & Conflicts with Other Models
**Conflicts with Margin of Safety**: Feedback loops encourage reinvestment of gains; Margin of Safety says preserve reserves. *Resolution*: Use feedback loops for growth phases; activate Margin of Safety when approaching resource limits.

**Measurement Challenge**: How do you quantify loop strength? Without metrics, you're designing blind. *Solution*: Before relying on a loop, measure its amplification factor.

**Lag Risk**: Long delays between action and feedback create instability. The faster the feedback, the more reliable the loop. *Implication*: Be skeptical of slow-feedback loops that don't show results for years.

#### 7. Strategic Questions
- "What feedback loops are currently active in our system?"
- "Which loops amplify what we want? Which amplify what we don't?"
- "How can we strengthen positive loops and weaken negative ones?"
- "Where are dangerous feedback delays that could destabilize us?"
- "How do I measure the strength of each feedback loop?"
- "As we scale, how will these loops change?"
- "When should I override positive loops with Margin of Safety reserves?"
