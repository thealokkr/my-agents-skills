### Guidelines to Apply Opportunity Cost Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Principle
Opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative foregone when making a choice. Every decision has a cost: what you're NOT doing with those resources.

#### 2. Recognize Opportunity Cost
Where it matters:

- **Time Allocation**: Choosing one task means not doing another
- **Capital Allocation**: Investing in Project A means not funding Project B
- **Career Choices**: Pursuing Path X means not pursuing Path Y
- **Talent Assignment**: Putting top performer on Task A means they're not on Task B
- **Space Decisions**: Using office space for X means not using it for Y
- **Strategy Decisions**: Focusing on Market A means leaving Market B to competitors

#### 3. Calculate Opportunity Cost
Thinking through the trade-off:

- **Identify Alternatives**: What are all viable options?
- **Assess Each**: What's the expected value of each option?
- **Calculate the Gap**: The difference is the opportunity cost
- **Weight Hidden Costs**: Some costs aren't obvious (morale impact, strategic position, optionality)
- **Consider Time Horizon**: Short-term vs. long-term opportunity costs differ

#### 4. Make Better Decisions by Accounting for Opportunity Cost
- **Be Explicit**: State what you're not doing when you choose to do something
- **Compare True Alternatives**: Not just chosen vs. zero, but chosen vs. next best
- **Value Alternative**: Put a number on what's being sacrificed
- **Prioritize**: Focus resources on what has highest advantage over alternatives
- **Say No Intentionally**: Rejecting alternatives with high opportunity cost requires justification

#### 5. Apply to Common Decisions
- **Hiring**: Spending $200K on this person means not hiring 5 junior people
- **Feature Development**: Building Feature X means delaying Features Y and Z
- **Partnerships**: Pursuing Partner A limits ability to pursue Partner B
- **Leadership Time**: Time spent on this issue is time not spent on that one
- **Capex Spending**: Money for facilities is money not available for R&D

#### 6. Strategic Questions
- "What am I NOT doing by choosing to do this?"
- "What's the next best alternative I'm giving up?"
- "Is the value of this choice clearly greater than alternatives?"
- "Are we clear about what opportunity costs we're accepting?"
- "Could we be making this decision better if we explicitly compared alternatives?"
