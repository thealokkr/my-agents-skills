### Guidelines to Apply Availability Heuristic Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Principle
Availability Heuristic: Overweighting information that is easy to recall because it is salient, recent, or emotionally memorable. We judge frequency and probability based on how easily examples come to mind, not actual statistics.

#### 2. How it Works
The mechanism of availability bias:

- **Salience**: Memorable events feel more common than they are
- **Recency Bias**: Recent events loom larger than historical patterns
- **Emotional Impact**: Scary events inflate perceived probability (plane crashes)
- **Personal Experience**: Our specific experiences feel representative (survivorship bias)
- **Media Coverage**: Heavily covered events feel more common
- **Vividness**: Dramatic examples stick in memory, averages don't

#### 3. Consequences
Where it causes problems:

- **Risk Misestimation**: Overestimate risks like terrorism (visible) vs automotive crashes (common)
- **Opportunity Recognition**: Miss opportunities because they're not top of mind
- **Market Timing**: Chase hot sectors because everyone's talking about them
- **Personnel Decisions**: Remember recent failure while forgetting historical pattern of success
- **Investment Decisions**: Overweight dramatic examples in your experience
- **Policy Decisions**: Respond to visible crises while missing systemic issues

#### 4. Common Examples
- Fear of flying despite drowning being more likely
- Overtrading due to recent good decisions
- Overweighting a recent failure in employee evaluation
- Chasing cryptocurrencies because media is full of stories
- Risk assessment based on news coverage, not actual statistics
- Judging company health based on recent quarterly results

#### 5. Counteract Availability Bias
- **Use Statistics**: Replace memorable examples with actual data
- **Base Rates**: Compare to historical frequency, not specific memorable cases
- **Diverse Information Sources**: Seek variety rather than concentrating on what's top of mind
- **Track Numerically**: Count actual instances rather than relying on memory
- **Question Salience**: Ask "why is this easy to remember?" (might be marketing or coincidence)
- **Diversify Experience**: Expand beyond personal experience
- **Decision Frameworks**: Use processes that force consideration of base rates

#### 6. Strategic Questions
- "Why is this particular example coming to mind?"
- "How does this compare to actual statistical frequency?"
- "Are there many examples I'm not remembering?"
- "Is my emotional reaction to a vivid example clouding probability assessment?"
- "What would the data say if I removed memorable examples?"
