### Guidelines to Apply Regression to the Mean Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Principle
Extreme outcomes tend to moderate over time. Very good or very poor performance will likely move closer to average in subsequent periods. This doesn't mean the system changed—just that randomness often plays a role.

#### 2. Recognize Regression in Action
Identify where regression appears:

- **Exceptional Performance**: An unusually successful quarter often isn't sustainable
- **One-Time Failures**: A disastrous period is often followed by improvement
- **Outlier Individuals**: Exceptionally talented people may underperform their first success
- **Market Cycles**: Booming markets and crashes both revert toward trends
- **Luck Factors**: Random good/bad fortune temporarily amplifies skill differences

#### 3. Separate Skill from Luck
Before drawing conclusions about performance:

- **Is the variance normal?** Some variation is expected and doesn't indicate fundamental change
- **What's driving it?** Is the change due to skill improvement or just randomness?
- **What's the baseline?** Compare to historical norms, not just one exceptional period
- **Will it persist?** Will the conditions that created the outlier continue?

#### 4. Avoid Common Mistakes
- **Misattribution of Causation**: "This new manager caused the improvement" when it's regression
- **Regression to the Mediocre**: Punishing excellent performance based on regression expectations
- **Ignoring Real Change**: Not recognizing when actual improvement has occurred
- **Overreacting**: Making major changes based on single outlier results

#### 5. Apply in Decision-Making
- **Invest Carefully**: Success in Year 1 doesn't guarantee Year 2 success
- **Patience with Variability**: Accept that performance naturally fluctuates
- **Set Realistic Expectations**: Plan for mean performance, not outlier performance
- **Monitor Trends**: Look for sustained change, not single-period variations
- **Evaluate Thoroughly**: Before adopting changes, verify they're causes, not correlation with regression

#### 6. Strategic Questions
- "Is this result typical or extreme?"
- "What factors are contributing to this outlier performance?"
- "How much of this is skill versus luck?"
- "Will the conditions that created this result persist?"
- "Am I reacting appropriately to regression versus real change?"
