### Guidelines to Apply Inversion Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Approach
Instead of asking "How do I achieve success?", ask "How do I guarantee failure?" Then reverse the answers.

This technique reveals obstacles and blind spots that forward-thinking might miss.

#### 2. Identify Failure Scenarios
Systematically reverse the problem:

- **Direct Question**: "How do I make this project successful?"
- **Inverted Question**: "How could I guarantee this project fails?"
- **Reverse the Answers**: What must I avoid to prevent failure?

#### 3. Common Failure Patterns to Avoid
Guide the analysis across key dimensions:

- **Planning**: Avoid inadequate preparation and unclear objectives
- **Execution**: Avoid poor communication and lack of accountability
- **Resources**: Avoid insufficient funding, talent, or tools
- **Stakeholders**: Avoid alienating key stakeholders or misaligning incentives
- **Adaptability**: Avoid rigidity when facing changing circumstances
- **Effort**: Avoid cutting corners or taking shortcuts on critical elements

#### 4. Conduct a Force Field Analysis
Map the forces that impede success:

- **List Obstacles**: What factors work against the goal?
- **Estimate Impact**: How significant is each obstacle?
- **Prioritize**: Which obstacles are most critical to address?
- **Develop Mitigation Strategies**: How can each obstacle be reduced or eliminated?

#### 5. Build a Positive Roadmap
Convert avoidance strategies into actionable positive steps:

- "Instead of avoiding X, I will ensure Y"
- "Instead of preventing failure in Z, I will actively build strength in W"
- Create specific, measurable countermeasures for each identified threat

#### 6. Review Regularly
- "What have we successfully avoided so far?"
- "Are new failure modes emerging?"
- "Have we inadvertently created new risks while avoiding others?"

#### 7. Limits & Conflicts with Other Models
**Conflicts with Activation Energy**: Inversion identifies all risks, which can paralyze action; Activation Energy says start despite uncertainty to overcome inertia. *Resolution*: Use Inversion in planning phase to identify true critical risks; use Activation Energy for execution despite minor risks.

**Over-Inclusive**: Inversion can identify every possible failure, leading to analysis paralysis. *Reality*: Not all failure modes matter equally. Some are rare (low probability) or low-impact. *Implication*: After inversion, still prioritize by consequence, not just by enumeration.

**Past-Heavy**: Inversion learns from failures that happened; misses novel failure modes in new domains. *Limitation*: Inversion is strong for repeat decisions, weaker for truly novel decisions.

#### 8. Temporal & Phase Guidance
When to apply Inversion:

**Best for:**
- PLANNING phase: Identify risks before committing resources
- STRATEGY/ARCHITECTURE: Before major irreversible decisions, invert to catch systemic risks
- CRITICAL FAILURES: When failure would be catastrophic, inversion finds invisible risks

**Less ideal for:**
- EXECUTION phase: Stop planning, execute. Inversion mid-execution creates paralysis
- CRISIS response: No time for comprehensive risk analysis; act decisively
- TACTICAL decisions: Small reversible decisions don't warrant full inversion analysis
- NOVELTY situations: Inversion assumes historical failure modes exist; novel domains have different failure modes

#### 9. Strategic Questions
- "How could we fail catastrophically at this goal?"
- "What would guarantee the worst outcome?"
- "Who do we know that failed at something similar? Why?"
- "What would we have to believe for this to be a bad decision?"
- "What mistakes would guarantee failure?"
- "Which failure modes are actually likely, and which are just possible?"
- "Is this decision novel enough that historical failure modes don't apply?"
- "When should I move forward despite unresolved risks from inversion analysis?"
- "Is this the right phase to be doing inversion analysis, or should I move to execution?"
