### Guidelines to Apply Thought Experiment Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Purpose
Thought experiments use imagination to explore theoretical implications, test ideas in impossible scenarios, and reveal hidden assumptions without real-world consequences.

#### 2. Design a Thought Experiment
Follow this structure:

- **Identify the Question**: What assumption or theory do you want to test?
- **Create the Scenario**: Imagine an extreme or impossible situation related to your question
- **Isolate Variables**: Simplify the scenario to focus on key factors
- **Imagine Consequences**: What would logically follow in this scenario?
- **Extract Insights**: What does this reveal about the real world?

#### 3. Build the Experiment
- **Initial Setup**: Describe the starting conditions clearly
- **Modification**: Change one key element or push a variable to an extreme
- **Follow the Logic**: Trace through consequences with clarity and rigor
- **Identify Patterns**: What does this reveal about principles or relationships?

#### 4. Common Types of Thought Experiments
- **Extreme Cases**: Push variables to their limits (e.g., "What if electricity cost $1,000 per kilowatt?")
- **Hypothetical Scenarios**: Imagine conditions that don't currently exist (e.g., "What if AI had human consciousness?")
- **Reversal Tests**: Swap relationships or positions to test assumptions
- **Boundary Testing**: Examine edge cases where rules might break down

#### 5. Apply Insights to Reality
- "How does this extreme scenario illuminate the real situation?"
- "What assumptions have I challenged?"
- "What principles remain true even when variables change?"
- "How can I test the insights in smaller, real-world ways?"
