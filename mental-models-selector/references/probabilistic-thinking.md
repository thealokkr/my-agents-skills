### Guidelines to Apply Probabilistic Thinking Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Core Principle
Probabilistic thinking involves recognizing that most real-world outcomes are not certain. Instead of thinking in binary terms (success/failure), think in terms of probability distributions and expected values.

#### 2. Replace Certainty Thinking with Probability Thinking
Shift your mental model:

- **Instead of**: "This will happen" → **Think**: "There's an X% chance this happens"
- **Instead of**: "This is impossible" → **Think**: "The probability is very low, but not zero"
- **Instead of**: "I'm sure this is correct" → **Think**: "I'm Y% confident based on available evidence"

#### 3. Develop a Probability Estimation Framework
Build systematic ways to estimate likelihoods:

- **Base Rates**: What's the historical frequency of this type of outcome?
- **Reference Classes**: What similar situations have occurred, and what were their outcomes?
- **Evidence Evaluation**: What evidence supports or contradicts different outcomes?
- **Confidence Levels**: Rate your confidence (High, Medium, Low) based on data quality and certainty
- **Bias Awareness**: Recognize common biases (overconfidence, anchoring, availability bias)

#### 4. Calculate Expected Value
Combine probability with impact for better decisions:

- **Expected Value = (Probability) × (Outcome Value)**
- Evaluate multiple scenarios and their likelihoods
- Choose actions with the highest expected value, not just the best single outcome

#### 5. Think in Scenarios and Ranges
Use ranges instead of point estimates:

- **Optimistic Scenario**: What's the best realistic outcome and its probability?
- **Base Case Scenario**: What's the most likely outcome?
- **Pessimistic Scenario**: What's the worst realistic outcome and its probability?
- **Black Swan Events**: What low-probability, high-impact events could occur?

#### 6. Test Your Assumptions
- "What evidence would change my probability estimate?"
- "Am I overconfident or underconfident based on similar past situations?"
- "What assumptions am I making about the probability distribution?"
- "How would I calibrate my predictions against actual outcomes?"

#### 7. Embrace Uncertainty
- Use language that reflects uncertainty: "likely," "probably," "there's a chance"
- Avoid false certainty in your decisions and communication
- Update your probabilities as new information becomes available
