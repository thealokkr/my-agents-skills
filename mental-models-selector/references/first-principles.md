### Guidelines to Apply First Principles Mental Model

#### 1. Guide the User Through Socratic Questioning
Use the following questioning/framing techniques to help deconstruct beliefs and assumptions:

- **Clarify Thinking**: Examine the origins and nature of your ideas
  - "Why do I think this?"
  - "What exactly do I think?"

- **Challenge Assumptions**: Test the validity of underlying beliefs
  - "How do I know this is true?"
  - "What if I thought the opposite?"

- **Seek Evidence**: Ground reasoning in verifiable facts
  - "How can I back this up?"
  - "What are the sources?"

- **Consider Alternative Perspectives**: Explore different viewpoints
  - "What might others think?"
  - "How do I know I am correct?"

- **Examine Consequences**: Evaluate implications and potential errors
  - "What if I am wrong?"
  - "What are the consequences if I am?"

- **Question the Question**: Reflect on the reasoning process itself
  - "Why did I think that?"
  - "Was I correct?"
  - "What conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?"

#### 2. Apply the Five Whys Technique
- Ask "Why?" repeatedly (typically five times) to dig deeper and uncover the root cause or fundamental truth behind a problem or assumption.

#### 3. Temporal & Context Guidance
When to use First Principles:

**Best for:**
- DISCOVERY/EXPLORATION phase: When designing new approaches or questioning existing paradigms
- STRATEGY/ARCHITECTURE decisions: Major, irreversible commitments benefit from first principles rigor
- DISAGREEMENT RESOLUTION: When teams have conflicting views on what's fundamentally true

**Less ideal for:**
- EXECUTION phase: First principles is slow; once committed, move faster
- TACTICAL decisions: Small reversible decisions don't warrant full first-principles analysis
- TIME-CRITICAL situations: First principles requires deliberation; not appropriate for crisis response
- REPETITIVE problems: If you've solved this before from first principles, use the pattern next time

#### 4. Failure Modes to Avoid
- **First Principles That Are Actually Wrong**: Verify assumptions are actually fundamental, not just conventional wisdom
- **False Simplicity**: Sometimes "first principles" is just oversimplification. Reality is complex; make sure you're reducing to true components, not removing important nuance
- **Analysis Paralysis**: First principles can identify infinite edge cases. Set bounds on analysis depth.

#### 5. Present key insights, POV and recommendations.
