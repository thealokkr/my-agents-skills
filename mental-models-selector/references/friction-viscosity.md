### Guidelines to Apply Friction & Viscosity Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Principle
Friction and Viscosity: Forces that oppose movement or describe the "thickness" of an environment, which varies depending on scale. In organizations, this means resistance to progress, information flow, and change.

#### 2. Types of Friction in Systems
Identify sources of resistance:

- **Organizational Friction**: Bureaucracy, approval processes, decision-making delays
- **Communication Friction**: Information silos, poor communication channels, distance
- **Cultural Friction**: Resistance to change, conflicting values, lack of trust
- **Technical Friction**: System integration challenges, legacy technology constraints
- **Relational Friction**: Interpersonal conflicts, misaligned incentives
- **Physical Friction**: Geographic distribution, coordination challenges across locations
- **Procedural Friction**: Cumbersome processes, excessive gatekeeping

#### 3. Cost of Friction
Impact on organizations:

- **Speed**: Friction slows decision-making and execution
- **Coordination**: Cross-team efforts become expensive and slow
- **Innovation**: New ideas face resistance and obstacles
- **Motivation**: Friction creates frustration and disengagement
- **Talent**: High-friction environments drive away good people
- **Consistency**: Information bottlenecks lead to inconsistent execution
- **Cost**: Workarounds and rework add expense

#### 4. Reduce Friction Strategically
Lower resistance to progress:

- **Streamline Processes**: Eliminate unnecessary approval/review steps
- **Flatten Structure**: Reduce layers between decision-makers
- **Communication Channels**: Create direct information flows
- **Trust Building**: Invest in relationships that reduce need for oversight
- **Aligned Incentives**: Remove conflicting goals between groups
- **Technology**: Use tools to span geographic and organizational distance
- **Culture Shift**: Build speed and change as values
- **Remove Gatekeepers**: Empower people to act without excessive permission-seeking

#### 5. Scale Effects on Friction
Friction increases with scale:

- **Growing Organization**: What works at 50 people creates friction at 500
- **Geographic Distribution**: Friction increases dramatically with locations
- **Functional Specialization**: More departments = more coordination friction
- **Process Formalization**: What freed people at small scale constrains larger org
- **Review Complexity**: More approvers = slower decisions
- **Authority Clarity**: As org grows, confusion about who decides creates friction

#### 6. Strategic Applications
- **Competitive Advantage**: Low-friction organizations outmove high-friction competitors
- **Scaling Strategy**: Plan friction reduction as you scale
- **Startup Advantage**: Startups win partly through low friction
- **Cultural Decisions**: Friction-reducing behaviors become cultural norms
- **Technology Investment**: Tools that reduce friction have high ROI

#### 7. Strategic Questions
- "Where is friction slowing important work?"
- "What's costing us in terms of friction overhead?"
- "What processes could we simplify or eliminate?"
- "How is our friction affecting competitiveness?"
- "As we scale, how do we maintain low friction?"
