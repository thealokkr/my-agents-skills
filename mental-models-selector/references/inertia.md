### Guidelines to Apply Inertia Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Principle
Objects at rest tend to stay at rest; objects in motion tend to stay in motion—unless an external force acts upon them. In organizations and minds, inertia means resistance to change in direction or speed.

#### 2. Recognize Inertia in Systems
Identify where inertia exists:

- **Organizational Direction**: Once set on a path, organizations resist changing course
- **Individual Habits**: Personal routines persist despite being counterproductive
- **Policies and Procedures**: Systems continue to operate even after the reasons for them disappear
- **Culture and Values**: Organizational beliefs persist even when circumstances change
- **Investment Patterns**: Money continues flowing to old priorities despite new needs

#### 3. Understand Why Inertia Exists
- **Sunk Cost Effects**: Investment already made makes change feel like loss
- **Coordination Challenges**: Changing direction requires many people to adapt simultaneously
- **Uncertainty**: Staying the course feels safer than charting a new path
- **Power Structures**: Those benefiting from current direction resist change
- **Identity**: "This is what we do" becomes tied to identity

#### 4. Overcome Inertia
To change direction, you need sufficient external force:

- **Create Crisis or Urgency**: Make staying the course feel more dangerous than changing
- **Build Coalition**: Get enough powerful actors behind the change to overcome resistance
- **Provide Certainty**: Paint a clear (and compelling) vision of the new direction
- **Make Change Reversible**: Lower the perceived risk by framing as experimental
- **Celebrate Momentum**: Once change starts, reinforce it with wins and recognition

#### 5. Harness Inertia
Use momentum when it serves your goals:

- **Build on Success**: Once moving in a good direction, maintain momentum
- **Compound Effects**: Small repeated actions build power over time
- **Market Position**: Established market position has inertia that competitors must overcome
- **Culture**: Once healthy culture develops, it perpetuates itself

#### 6. Strategic Questions
- "What's causing resistance to this needed change?"
- "Where do we have helpful momentum to leverage?"
- "What external force would it take to shift this inertia?"
- "Are we trapped by sunk costs we should abandon?"
- "Have we built inertia that now protects our position?"
