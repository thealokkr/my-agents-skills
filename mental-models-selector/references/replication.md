### Guidelines to Apply Replication Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Principle
Replication: The high-fidelity transfer of information (like DNA in biology or a business model) to scale successful structures. What works once can be replicated to scale success.

#### 2. What Gets Replicated
Understanding replicable elements:

- **Business Models**: Proven ways of creating and capturing value
- **Processes**: Documented procedures that consistently produce results
- **Cultural Elements**: Values, norms, and behaviors that define organization
- **Technical Systems**: Code, infrastructure, and technological approaches
- **Strategies**: Successful approaches to market competition and customer acquisition
- **Organizational Structures**: Reporting relationships, team compositions, decision-making patterns
- **Products**: Features and designs that customers value

#### 3. Requirements for Successful Replication
What must be true:

- **Clarity**: What's being replicated must be clearly understood
- **Documentation**: Implicit knowledge must be made explicit
- **Teachability**: Elements must be transferable to new contexts
- **Fidelity**: Replication must maintain essential characteristics
- **Adaptation Space**: Allow some contextual adaptation without losing identity
- **Quality Control**: Ensure copies maintain standards
- **Feedback Loops**: Monitor replicated versions for drift

#### 4. Replication at Different Scales
Challenges change with scale:

**Few Replications**
- Direct guidance and mentorship possible
- High-fidelity replication easier
- Can customize heavily
- Quality more assured

**Many Replications**
- Documentation becomes critical
- Systems and automation support consistency
- Cultural transmission more challenging
- Quality variation increases
- Adaptation becomes decentralized

#### 5. Challenges in Replication
Where replication fails:

- **Implicit Knowledge**: Tacit knowledge difficult to transfer (e.g., sales intuition)
- **Context Dependency**: What works in one context fails in another
- **Quality Degradation**: Each copy degrades slightly from original
- **Adaptation Gaps**: Replication too rigid or too loose
- **Cultural Loss**: Values and culture hard to replicate without founder
- **Emergent Properties**: Systems work partly through emergent interactions hard to specify
- **Environmental Changes**: Context that made original successful no longer exists

#### 6. Scale Through Replication
- **Franchise Model**: Replicate entire business model with partners
- **Chain Expansion**: Same store/location format replicated
- **Licensing**: License your model to others to replicate
- **Acquiring Companies**: Buy competitors and convert to your model
- **Internal Scaling**: Replicate departments/teams as organization grows

#### 7. Strategic Questions
- "What's working that we should replicate?"
- "What's the minimal set of elements we need to replicate?"
- "Can we document this well enough to scale?"
- "What gets lost in replication that matters?"
- "How do we balance consistency with contextual adaptation?"
