### Guidelines to Apply Tragedy of the Commons Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Principle
Tragedy of the Commons: When a shared resource is depleted because individual incentives to use it override collective well-being. Each person's rational self-interest leads to collective irrationality.

#### 2. Recognize the Pattern
Where tragedy occurs:

- **Environmental**: Overfishing with shared ocean, air pollution from individual emissions
- **Organizational**: Using shared resources (meeting rooms, equipment) inefficiently
- **Information**: Free content that supports platform but content creators don't benefit
- **Relationships**: Taking advantage of patience/goodwill until relationship breaks
- **Health**: Pandemic behavior where individual freedom harms collective health
- **Traffic**: Selfish driving creates congestion that slows everyone down

#### 3. The Core Mechanism
How tragedy emerges:

- **Shared Resource**: Something valuable that everyone can access
- **Individual Incentive**: Increased use benefits the individual
- **Diffuse Cost**: Costs of overuse are spread across all users
- **Lack of Enforcement**: No authority prevents overuse
- **Rational Selfishness**: Each actor perceives optimal strategy as maximum personal use
- **Collective Damage**: Result is resource depletion despite being bad for all

#### 4. Solutions to Tragedy
Different approaches to prevent depletion:

- **Privatization**: Convert shared to private ownership; owner protects value
- **Regulation**: Rules and monitoring to limit individual use
- **Quota System**: Allocate allowed use to each user
- **Pricing**: Charge for use to reduce demand and fund management
- **Social Norms**: Make conservation culturally important
- **Collective Management**: Community governance that enforces sustainable use
- **Reduce Incentive**: Make individual use less attractive (e.g., congestion pricing)

#### 5. Apply in Organizations
- **Meeting Room Booking**: Without enforcement, rooms occupied but unused
- **Equipment**: Shared tools deteriorate without individual accountability
- **Parking**: Unlimited spots get abused; rationing or pricing needed
- **Time**: Shared team time used inefficiently without agenda discipline
- **Data**: Shared databases need governance or quality degrades

#### 6. Strategic Questions
- "What shared resources in our system are being overused?"
- "Are individual incentives aligned with collective good?"
- "What mechanism is preventing overuse?"
- "If current mechanism disappears, would commons collapse?"
- "How do we redesign incentives to protect shared resources?"
