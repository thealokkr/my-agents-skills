### Guidelines to Apply Dunbar's Number Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Principle
Dunbar's Number (~150) is the theoretical cognitive limit to the number of people with whom someone can maintain stable social relationships. **Important**: The actual number varies dramatically by context (50-500), not a fixed universal constant.

Context factors that shift the number:
- **Shared Purpose**: Teams with clear shared mission can maintain relationships at larger scale (higher end)
- **Technology**: Digital tools extend capacity; physical-only is more limited
- **Turnover**: Stable teams maintain larger sizes; high-turnover groups operate at lower end
- **Diversity**: Homogeneous groups maintain larger scales; diverse groups hit limits sooner
- **Communication Frequency**: High-frequency interaction allows larger groups; rare contact limits scale

#### 2. Recognize Dunbar Effects
How the limit manifests:

- **Communication Breakdown**: At ~150, you can't network everyone with everyone
- **Culture Dilution**: Shared values harder to maintain beyond this scale
- **Trust Assumptions**: At smaller scales you know people; at larger scales you know roles
- **Sub-Groups**: Natural clustering into smaller groups within larger organizations
- **Coordination Challenge**: Direct coordination becomes impossible; structure becomes necessary

#### 3. Dunbar's Layers
Understanding the hierarchy of relationship scales:

- **Intimate Circle** (~5): People you confide in
- **Friendship Circle** (~15): Close friends you see regularly
- **Social Circle** (~50): Acquaintances you interact with
- **Organizational Circle** (~150): People you could have a casual conversation with
- **Beyond**: At 150+, you need systems and structure

#### 4. The 150 Boundary Effects
What changes at the threshold of ~150 people:

- **From Acquaintance to Stranger**: You can't know people personally anymore
- **From Culture to Policy**: Can't rely on shared understanding; need documented rules
- **From Decision by Consensus**: Need formal decision-making structures
- **From Reputation to Process**: Can't rely on personal reputation alone
- **From Informal to Formal**: Informal coordination breaks down

#### 5. Organizational Implications
- **Team Size**: Keep core working teams well under 150
- **Unit Size**: Each autonomous unit should be <150 for coherence
- **Scaling Structure**: As you grow, create clear sub-units before breaking the number
- **Leadership Span**: One leader can directly manage ~15 people; beyond that, need layers
- **Culture**: Explicitly manage culture beyond what naturally emerges at <150

#### 6. Context Modifiers: When Is Your Dunbar Number Different?
- **Higher Range (200-500)**: Shared mission, high communication frequency, homogeneous team, stable (low turnover)
- **Lower Range (50-100)**: Diverse perspectives, new relationships, high complexity, changing membership
- **Test Your Own**: Where does your group's coordination break down? That's your local Dunbar number, not necessarily 150.

#### 7. Strategic Questions
- "Is our team approaching the size where informal coordination breaks down?"
- "Do we have the right structure for our current size?"
- "How should we organize when we cross our local Dunbar threshold?"
- "Are we trying to manage too large a group with informal coordination?"
- "How can we keep sub-cultures healthy as organization scales?"
- "What's our actual Dunbar number given our specific context and communication patterns?"
- "Could we shift context factors to increase our coordination capacity without adding structure?"
