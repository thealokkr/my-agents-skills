### Guidelines to Apply Scarcity Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Principle
Limited resources drive value and competition. Scarcity creates incentives, shapes priorities, and determines what's valuable. Abundance of something typically reduces its value.

#### 2. Identify Scarce Resources in Your Domain
Recognize what's limited:

- **Time**: Everyone has 24 hours; how you allocate it determines outcomes
- **Attention**: Overwhelmed with information; focused attention is scarce
- **Talent**: Top performers are always in short supply
- **Capital**: Money available for investment is limited
- **Land**: Physical space becomes more valuable as density increases
- **Intellectual Property**: Unique ideas and know-how
- **Relationships**: Quality relationships with key people
- **Trust**: Credibility and reputation in market

#### 3. How Scarcity Drives Behavior
Understand the dynamics:

- **Valuation**: Scarce = valuable; abundant = cheap
- **Rationing**: Scarcity creates triage decisions on allocation
- **Persistence of Value**: Scarce resources hold value longer
- **Competition Intensity**: Scarcity increases competition for what's available
- **Innovation**: Scarcity drives innovation to overcome limits
- **Hoarding**: Scarcity creates tendency to stockpile

#### 4. Leverage Scarcity
Create advantage through understanding scarcity:

- **Control Choke Points**: Dominate scarce resources bottleneck
- **Create Artificial Scarcity**: Limit availability to maintain value (exclusivity)
- **Accumulate Scarcity**: Build reserves of what's scarce before it becomes crisis
- **Trade Scarcity**: Exchange resources you have excess of for what's scarce
- **Invest in Scarcity**: Develop rare skills or relationships before they're needed

#### 5. Overcome Scarcity
When scarcity is limiting:

- **Substitute**: Find alternative resources less scarce
- **Increase Supply**: Generate or manufacture what's lacking
- **Use More Efficiently**: Do more with less (process improvement)
- **Redistribute**: Move from surplus to deficit areas
- **Create Abundance**: Technology or process innovations that remove scarcity

#### 6. Strategic Questions
- "What resources are truly scarce in my domain?"
- "How does scarcity affect our competitive position?"
- "Are we sitting on scarce resources we could monetize?"
- "What appear scarce but could be made abundant through innovation?"
- "How can we build advantage before scarcity becomes critical?"
