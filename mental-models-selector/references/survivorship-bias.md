### Guidelines to Apply Survivorship Bias Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Principle
Survivorship Bias: Distorted understanding created by looking only at winners (survivors) and ignoring "forgotten failures." The visible examples aren't representative of all attempts.

#### 2. How it Works
The mechanism:

- **Visibility**: Successful companies, agents, products are visible; failures fade from memory
- **Inference Error**: Assume characteristics of winners caused their success
- **Selection Effect**: Sample of visible cases is biased toward success
- **Attribution Error**: Credit winner's attributes while ignoring luck or context
- **Forgetting Failures**: Countless attempts succeed at low rates; survivors are visible
- **False Lessons**: Learn lessons from survivors without knowing what failed attempts did

#### 3. Classic Examples
- **Warren Buffett Effect**: Study Buffett's strategies, ignoring the thousands of investors who used same approach and failed
- **Startup Success Stories**: Read about successful entrepreneurs, ignoring 90% failure rate
- **Lottery Winners**: Interview lottery winners about their strategy, ignoring millions of lottery players who lost
- **Mutual Fund Managers**: Historical data shows some beat market, ignoring those who underperformed and were shut down
- **Stock Performance**: Study past winners assuming they'll continue winning, ignoring regression to mean

#### 4. Where Survivorship Bias Causes Problems
- **Strategy Copying**: Adopt winning company's strategies ignoring their contextual advantages
- **Hiring Mistakes**: Hire people because they resemble successful entrepreneurs (many similar people failed)
- **Product Development**: Pursue ideas because successful company did them (ignoring failed attempts)
- **Investment Decisions**: Buy stocks based on past winners assuming they'll continue
- **Career Advice**: Follow advice from successful people who may have gotten lucky
- **Historical Learning**: Draw lessons from wars/events without knowing counterfactuals

#### 5. Combat Survivorship Bias
- **Study Failures**: Actively research what failed attempts look like
- **Know the Base Rate**: Of 100 who try X, how many succeed? (survivors are the visible ones)
- **Examine Context**: What made this survivor different? Was it skill or circumstances?
- **Randomness Acknowledgment**: Some success is luck; lucky people don't know they're lucky
- **Examine Similar Non-Winners**: Why did this company survive while competitors with similar strategy failed?
- **Counterexamples**: Find cases where winners' strategies failed
- **Sample Broadly**: Don't just study the most famous successes

#### 6. Strategic Questions
- "Am I learning from survivors while ignoring failures?"
- "What base rate applies? Of 100 who try this, how many succeed?"
- "What did failures have in common with winners?"
- "How much of this success was strategy vs. luck/context?"
- "If I replicate the winner's approach, am I likely to replicate their success?"
