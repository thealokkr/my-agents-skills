### Guidelines to Apply Hanlon's Razor Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Principle
Hanlon's Razor: Never attribute to malice that which is more easily explained by stupidity, incompetence, or human error.

Before assuming someone acted with ill intent, consider simpler explanations: oversight, ignorance, different priorities, or honest mistakes.

#### 2. Apply When Facing Apparent Wrongdoing
When someone's actions hurt you or your interests:

- **Assume Innocent Intent First**: What innocent explanations exist?
- **Consider Incompetence**: Is the person simply not skilled enough?
- **Think About Information Gaps**: Did they lack important context?
- **Recognize Different Priorities**: Were their goals different from what you assumed?
- **Accept Human Error**: How likely is simple mistake versus intentional harm?

#### 3. Common Innocent Explanations
- **Ignorance**: They didn't know the impact of their action
- **Negligence**: They weren't paying attention
- **Different Incentives**: They were optimizing for something else
- **Communication Breakdown**: Messages weren't received or understood
- **Resource Constraints**: They couldn't do what was needed
- **Competing Objectives**: They had legitimate priorities that conflicted

#### 4. When Malice Might Be Real
- **Pattern Recognition**: Is this a repeated behavior, not a single incident?
- **Clear Evidence**: Do you have explicit proof of intentional harm?
- **Rational Incentives**: Would they actually benefit from harming you?
- **Direct Statements**: Has the person explicitly stated harmful intent?

#### 5. When Hanlon's Razor Is Inapplicable (Critical Contexts)
Hanlon's assumes good-faith actors operating under uncertainty. It breaks down in:

- **Power Imbalances**: Where one party has clear leverage to exploit; they may rationally choose harm over cooperation
- **Predatory Contexts**: Sales scams, abuse, theft—situations where incentives explicitly reward deception
- **Resource Scarcity**: When resources are genuinely scarce, "incompetence" explanation often masks rational cost-cutting at others' expense
- **Organizational Politics**: Where reputation damage serves competitive advantage; "stupidity" may be strategic sabotage
- **Information Asymmetry with Incentive Misalignment**: When someone benefits from your ignorance, incompetence explanation becomes less likely

**Key Distinction**: Hanlon's works best with equals in cooperative contexts. In competitive or predatory contexts, incompetence may be cover for rational but harmful behavior.

#### 6. Apply This Principle Wisely
- **Context-Dependent**: Hanlon's is a starting assumption in cooperative contexts; shift toward skepticism in adversarial ones
- **Gather Information**: Before concluding, understand their perspective and incentive structure
- **Protect Yourself**: Even if someone didn't intend harm, still set boundaries and monitor behavior
- **Watch Incentives**: If someone benefits from harming you, reduce Hanlon's weight in your analysis
- **Pattern Over Incidents**: Single misdeeds can be incompetence; repeated patterns suggest rational choice

#### 7. Benefits and Outcomes
- Reduces unnecessary conflict and hostility
- Improves communication by assuming good intent
- Preserves relationships when miscommunication occurs
- Redirects energy toward solving problems rather than assigning blame
