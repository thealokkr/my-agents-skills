### Guidelines to Apply Gresham's Law Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Principle
Gresham's Law: The dark side of human nature where bad versions of something (counterfeit currency, low-quality products, or unethical behavior) drive out quality versions. People instinctively prefer benefit without the cost.

#### 2. The Core Mechanism
How bad drives out good:

- **Information Asymmetry**: Buyers can't easily distinguish quality from counterfeits
- **Price Differentiation**: Counterfeit is cheaper, making genuine look overpriced
- **Market Share**: Bad's advantage destabilizes the good's position
- **Cascade Effect**: As good disappears, market for counterfeit expands
- **Trust Erosion**: When bad is present, people trust category less
- **Economic Collapse**: Market eventually fails when quality is gone

#### 3. Recognize Gresham's Law Applications
Beyond currency, it appears in:

- **Content Markets**: Low-quality content can outcompete quality content
- **Hiring**: Candidates willing to exaggerate can outcompete honest ones
- **Service Industries**: Cutting corners becomes competitive when customers can't tell
- **Communication**: Sensationalism outcompetes nuance in attention market
- **Scientific Fields**: Fraudulent research can drive out legitimate work
- **Online Reviews**: Fake reviews can overwhelm genuine ones
- **Employment**: Unethical companies can outcompete ethical ones

#### 4. Protect Against Bad Driving Out Good
Maintain quality in the face of counterfeits:

- **Quality Signals**: Make quality visible (certification, testing, branding)
- **Differentiation**: Create clear distinction between quality and counterfeit
- **Price Justification**: Explain premium; show value delivered
- **Reputation Building**: Invest in trust and credibility mechanisms
- **Enforcement**: Combat counterfeits aggressively
- **Reduce Information Asymmetry**: Help customers understand differences
- **Community Standards**: Build norms that value quality over price

#### 5. Apply in Organizations
- **Hiring Standards**: Maintain rigorous standards or culture gets compromised
- **Quality Standards**: Don't let cost-cutting undermine standards
- **Ethical Standards**: Small compromises lead to bigger ones; maintain bright lines
- **Communication**: Balance efficiency with clarity; don't let buzzwords replace substance
- **Training**: Invest in quality training; cheap shortcut training drives out good practices

#### 6. Strategic Questions
- "Where might bad versions of our offering be entering the market?"
- "Are we competing on price in ways that undermine quality?"
- "What quality signals can we strengthen?"
- "Are our standards being undermined by competitor shortcuts?"
- "How do we prevent our market from becoming a race to the bottom?"
