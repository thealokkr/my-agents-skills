### Guidelines to Apply Representativeness Heuristic Mental Model

#### 1. Understand the Principle
Representativeness Heuristic: Judging probability based on how much something resembles a typical example of a category, while ignoring statistical base rates and sample size.

#### 2. How it Works
The mechanism of representativeness bias:

- **Category Matching**: Does this person/object match the stereotype of the category?
- **Ignoring Base Rates**: Overlook how common the category actually is
- **Ignoring Sample Size**: Treat small samples as representative of populations
- **Similarity Bias**: Assume that similar features indicate category membership
- **Stereotyping**: Rely on whether fit the stereotype rather than actual probability
- **Ignoring Prior Probability**: Don't account for starting likelihood

#### 3. Consequences
Where it causes problems:

- **Personnel Misjudgment**: "This person has the look of a successful CEO" ignoring track record
- **Investment Bias**: "This startup has the features of a unicorn" ignoring failure rate of startups
- **Hiring Errors**: Hiring based on resume resembling ideal candidate profile
- **Market Timing**: Assuming company resembling "winner" will succeed
- **Stereotyping**: Judging individuals based on group stereotypes
- **Forecasting**: Assuming situation resembling past success will succeed again

#### 4. Common Examples
- A person who is quiet and bookish is more likely to be a librarian than lawyer (ignoring there are many more lawyers)
- A detailed story about a company sounds like a successful startup (ignoring low success rates)
- Someone who likes classical music must be sophisticated (confusing correlation with category definition)
- A project with similar features to past successes will succeed (ignoring contextual differences)

#### 5. The Conjunction Fallacy
A specific example of representativeness:

- "Linda is single, outspoken, and interested in social justice" → seems like "feminist activist" than "bank teller"
- But mathematically: (Probability of A and B) ≤ (Probability of A alone)
- More specific descriptions feel more likely even though they're statistically less probable

#### 6. Counteract Representativeness Heuristic
- **Use Base Rates**: First consider how common the category actually is
- **Evaluate Sample Size**: Be skeptical of patterns from small samples
- **Statistical Thinking**: Calculate actual probabilities, not based on resemblance
- **Multiple Data Points**: Don't rely on a few salient features
- **Question Stereotypes**: Actively challenge category assumptions
- **Study Disconfirming Cases**: Understand examples that break the pattern
- **Reference Classes**: What similar situations actually produced what outcomes?

#### 6. Strategic Questions
- "How does this resemble the category, and is that relevant?"
- "What's the actual base rate for this category?"
- "How sure am I based on limited information?"
- "Are there many cases that resemble this but had different outcomes?"
- "Would I reach the same conclusion using statistical reasoning vs. resemblance?"
