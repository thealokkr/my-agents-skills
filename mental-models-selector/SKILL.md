## Introduction 

When facing complex decisions or exploring new opportunities, you're viewing them through a single frame—and missing what that frame obscures. This skill operates in two modes:

1. **Problem Mode**: Problem feels subjective/vague/wrong → identify blind spots → see it from 2-3+ alternative perspectives
2. **Opportunity Mode**: Have an idea or opportunity → stress-test assumptions → explore execution approaches → validate feasibility

Both modes use the same mental-model library to move from single-perspective thinking to multi-frame clarity.

## Goals

- **Problem Mode**: Identify blind spots, suggest 2-3+ alternative perspectives, move from emotional to structural analysis
- **Opportunity Mode**: Stress-test assumptions, explore execution approaches, validate feasibility before commitment
- **Both modes**: Surface implications of each frame so you can decide with eyes open

## Core Concepts Glossary

**Blind Spot**: An assumption you're making without noticing—often about how the problem works, what's possible, or whose perspective matters. Becomes visible when you shift mental frames.

**Frame**: A lens through which you see a problem (e.g., "This is a negotiation" vs. "This is a power dynamic"). Different frames make different facts visible and hide others.

**Walk Around the Problem**: View the same issue through 3+ different perspectives (engineer's view = systems; manager's view = incentives; biologist's view = evolution). Each reveals what the others hide.

**Let Models Compete**: When Frame A says "do X" and Frame B says "do Y," the conflict itself contains truth. Don't eliminate disagreement—examine it.

**Second-Order Effects**: Consequences that follow from your primary decision (if you cut costs, morale drops; if morale drops, talent leaves).

**Reversible vs. Irreversible**: One-way-door decisions need more caution. Two-way doors can be tried faster. Always classify first.

## Triggering Conditions

**Problem Mode** (Diagnosis):
- Problem feels subjective, vague, or "something's off" but you can't articulate why
- Stuck in one perspective; need to see it from multiple angles
- Emotional reaction (frustrated, angry, disrespected) needs structural analysis (risks, trade-offs)
- High-stakes decision; need blind-spot identification before committing
- Team disagreement rooted in different mental frames

**Opportunity Mode** (Exploration/Validation):
- Have an early-stage idea, product, or business model to explore
- Want to stress-test core assumptions before investing heavily
- Need to see execution approaches from different angles
- Want to validate feasibility and identify hidden risks
- Exploring adjacent opportunities or second-order effects


## Workflow Process

#### Step 0: Identify Your Mode

Before diving in, answer: **Am I solving a problem OR exploring an opportunity?**

- **Problem Mode**: "This feels wrong/stuck/unfair and I need clarity.What am I missing?"
- **Opportunity Mode**: "I have an idea/opportunity and want to test/explore it"

Your answer changes what you ask in Steps 1-4. Both modes use the same 48 mental models, but ask different questions.

#### Step 1: Contextual Analysis

1. Ask clarifying questions to understand the nuances of the problem, such as:
    - What are the key dynamics at play?
    - What are the constraints and resources available?
    - What are the desired outcomes and potential risks?
    - What is the time horizon for decision-making?
    - Who are the stakeholders involved and what are their incentives?
    - What are the potential blind spots or biases that might affect the analysis?
    - What is that which the user is concerned about or trying to achieve?
    - What is the specific problem or decision that needs to be analyzed?
    - What are the relevant factors and variables that should be considered in the analysis?
    - What are the potential consequences of different decisions or actions?

2. Walk around the problem: Look at a single issue through multiple lenses. For example, when analyzing a business, an engineer sees systems, a psychologist sees incentives, and a biologist sees evolution.
    - Let models compete: Real synthesis happens when you find situations where Model 1 tells you "X" and Model 2 tells you "Y". Letting these ideas fight for superiority is the sign of good thinking.
    - Identify hidden connections: Use models from one field to explain another, such as applying Reciprocity (physics) to human relationships or Catalysts (chemistry) to project management

#### Step 2: Identify Frames and Open Perspectives

1. Recognize what **kind** of decision you're facing:
   - **Structural** (Markets, systems, tradeoffs): Use Physics/Economics models (Leverage, Scale, Scarcity, Opportunity Cost)
   - **Dynamic** (People, change, adaptation): Use Biology/Evolution models (Red Queen, Ecosystems, Niches)
   - **Relational** (Fairness, behavior, incentives): Use Human/Social models (Reciprocity, Commitment, Hanlon's Razor)
   - **Uncertain** (Risk, probability, outcomes): Use Decision/Judgment models (Reversible vs. Irreversible, Probabilistic Thinking)

2. Open 2–3+ competing or complementary frames to see the problem from different angles

3. **Quick Scenario-to-Frame Lookup** (selected examples):
   - **Risk/Safety**: Margin of Safety, Reversible vs. Irreversible, Second-Order Thinking
   - **Growth/Scaling**: Leverage, Scale, Critical Mass, Feedback Loops
   - **People/Teams**: Dunbar's Number, Cooperation, Reciprocity, Commitment & Consistency
   - **Change/Resistance**: Inertia, Activation Energy, Creative Destruction
   - **Fairness/Conflict**: Hanlon's Razor, Reciprocity, Social Proof
   - **Uncertainty**: Probabilistic Thinking, Regression to the Mean, OODA Loop
   - **Complexity**: Systems Thinking, Emergence, First Principles, Map is Not Territory

#### Step 3: Apply Frames and Reveal Implications

For each frame, ask:
- **What does this perspective reveal?** (What becomes visible from this angle?)
- **What does it hide?** (What can't you see from this angle?)
- **How does this change what I'd do?** (Does this frame suggest different actions?)
- **Which frame fits my situation best?** (Which opens the most relevant blind spots?)

**How to "Let Frames Compete":**
- Place Frame A's conclusion next to Frame B's conclusion
- Ask: "Where do they conflict? What's driving the difference?"
- The conflict itself is the insight—don't smooth it over
- Example: "Frame A says negotiate (Reciprocity), Frame B says walk away (Margin of Safety). The tension tells me: negotiation is only valuable if we have a real alternative."
- Real clarity happens when you see where and *why* frames disagree

See `./references/` directory for detailed explanations, when-to-use guidance, and examples for each model.

### Step 4: Decide & Validate (Problem Mode) / Test & Refine (Opportunity Mode)

#### 4A: Compare & Weigh Frames

For each of your 2-3 frames, answer:
- **Clarity**: Does this frame reduce the subjective feeling? (Yes/Partially/No)
- **Actionability**: Do I know *concretely* what to do next? (Yes/Vague/No)
- **Risk**: What core assumption could be wrong? (State it)
- **Reversibility**: Is this a one-way or two-way door?

**Ranking Rule**: Prioritize frames that:
1. Address the *root* problem (not symptoms)
2. Reveal what the other frames hide
3. Have testable assumptions

# REFRAMING ANALYSIS

## What You Walked In With
**Your Original Frame**: [One sentence: how you saw it initially]
**Blind Spot**: [2-3 bullet points: what you couldn't see from that angle]

## Alternative Frames (2-3)

### Frame 1: [Name]
- **Perspective**: [What becomes visible here?]
- **Key Insight**: [What does this frame reveal?]
- **Core Assumption**: [What could be wrong?]
- **Implication**: [What would you do differently?]

### Frame 2: [Name]
- **Perspective**: [What becomes visible here?]
- **Key Insight**: [What does this frame reveal?]
- **Core Assumption**: [What could be wrong?]
- **Implication**: [What would you do differently?]

### Frame 3: [Name]
- [Same structure]

## Where Frames Compete
[If Frame 1 says "negotiate" and Frame 2 says "leverage," what does that tension reveal?]

## Your Decision
**Chosen Frame(s)**: [Which one(s) fit your situation?]
**Why**: [Justification based on comparison above]

## Pressure Test (Before Acting)
- [ ] What if my core assumption is wrong?
- [ ] What could reverse this decision?
- [ ] Who would disagree and from what frame?
- [ ] Am I reversible or in one-way-door territory?
- [ ] What second-order effects might follow?

## Next Steps
1. **This week**: [Immediate action]
2. **To validate**: [Key assumption to test]
3. **To revisit**: [When to re-examine this frame]
```

#### 4C: Make Your Call

**Don't pick one frame if multiple are relevant.** They often *stack*:
- Frame 1 shows structural risk (Reversible vs. Irreversible)
- Frame 2 shows power dynamic (Leverage)
- Frame 3 shows relationship risk (Reciprocity)

All three might inform your decision.

## Troubleshooting & Recovery Paths

**Stuck on Frame Selection (Can't Decide Which Models to Use)?**
- Start with decision *type* (Structural/Dynamic/Relational/Uncertain) rather than decision *content*
- Pick the first frame that makes you uncomfortable—that discomfort signals a blind spot
- If paralyzed by options, use just 3: one from Physics, one from Human/Social, one from Decision-Making

**Frames All Feel Equally Valid?**
- You've found "true ambiguity"—add a 4th frame from a new category
- The tension between Frame 1 and Frame 2 often resolves when Frame 3 raises a new question
- If still stuck, rank by: Which frame would I most regret ignoring?

**Clarity Gained But Still Uncertain What to Do?**
- Your chosen frame is right, but you need a *concrete next action*, not more analysis
- Translate the frame into: "If this frame is true, what's the smallest test I can run?"
- Stop reframing; start experimenting

**Team Can't Agree on Which Frame Applies?**
- Don't resolve it—use the disagreement
- Ask: "What does Frame A see that Frame B misses? What does Frame B see that Frame A misses?"
- Often the answer is "both apply, and we need to handle both risks"

**Getting Diminishing Returns (More Frames = Less Clarity)?**
- Stop at 3-4 frames maximum
- If you have more, one is probably not adding new insight
- Consolidate: "Frames 2 and 4 are pointing at the same risk from different angles"

**Always Do:**
- ✅ Understand *how they're currently framing the problem* before offering alternatives (their frame is valuable context)
- ✅ Offer 2-3+ competing or complementary frames (never one frame, one model)
- ✅ Show what **blind spot** each frame corrects (so they understand why it matters)
- ✅ Explain **how each frame changes the implications** (what you'd do differently)
- ✅ Let frames compete—show where they conflict (that tension is where truth lives)

**Never Do:**
- ❌ Stop at the first frame that seems to fit
- ❌ Name models without explaining what perspective they open
- ❌ Recommend a frame without showing what blind spot it fixes
- ❌ Treat all frames as equally valid (help them choose which actually fits)
- ❌ Forget to ask: "Are there other implications I'm missing?"


## Example Interaction

**Product Manager's Situation (Initial Frame):**
- Leadership asking for "deliver 3x more features in Q2 without adding headcount or budget"
- Feels: Impossible, like management doesn't understand the work, unrealistic deadline
- Frame: "They want miracles—this setup is broken"

**Blind Spots in This Frame:**
- Misses: What are the actual constraints vs. perceived constraints?
- Misses: What features matter most and which are "nice-to-have"?
- Misses: What could be automated, eliminated, or done cheaper?
- Misses: Why this target now? (What's the real driver?)

**Alternative Frames Offered:**

1. **Prioritization Frame** (Leverage): "We can't do 3x more with same resources, but we can *choose* 3x more impact per engineer"
   - Blind Spot Fixed: You were seeing "more features = more time," not "high-impact features = different distribution"
   - Implication: Ruthlessly cut low-impact work. Compress scope. Ask: "What's the 20% of features that drive 80% of value?"

2. **Systems/Efficiency Frame** (Physics - Leverage): "Current process has friction: meetings, approval chains, manual testing, rework cycles"
   - Blind Spot Fixed: You were seeing "people hours," not "process waste." Same team can do 3x if waste drops 40%
   - Implication: Map the actual time spent on: meetings, waiting, handoffs, rework. Cut those first. Automation compounds gains.

3. **Second-Order Thinking Frame** (Strategy): "If we cut corners now (tech debt, skip testing, overwork team), what costs do we pay in Q3-Q4?"
   - Blind Spot Fixed: You were seeing Q2 delivery risk, not the downstream consequences of how we deliver
   - Implication: Any "3x more" plan that relies on burnout or debt is a two-quarter problem, not a one-quarter win.

4. **Reversible vs. Irreversible Frame** (Decision): "Hiring is reversible (expensive but fixable). Code debt is semi-reversible. Team burnout is harder to reverse."
   - Blind Spot Fixed: You were treating all constraints equally; they're not. Some trades are costlier later
   - Implication: If the goal is genuinely impossible without hiring or debt, say that explicitly. Then negotiate which risk to take.

**Which Frame Fits Your Situation?**
- All of them. They're not competing—they're stacking.
- You came in seeing *stress* (it's impossible). Now you see *structure* (prioritization, waste, trade-offs, sustainability).
- **Your move**: Ask leadership: "3x features—do you mean 3x scope or 3x shipped value? Let's map what we actually cut, automate, and prioritize, then we'll tell you what's feasible within 2 weeks."


## Success Criteria

A successful reframing session includes:
- ✅ Clarified which mode you're in (Problem diagnosis vs. Opportunity exploration)
- ✅ Uncovered your **current frame** (how you're seeing the situation)
- ✅ Identified **blind spots** in that frame (what you can't see from that angle)
- ✅ Offered **2-3+ alternative frames** (competing or complementary perspectives)
- ✅ Showed **implications and conflicts** between frames (what each suggests you do, and where they clash)
- ✅ Moved you from **subjective thinking** (emotional reaction, gut feeling) to **structural thinking** (risks, trade-offs, leverage, assumptions)
- ✅ Validated your chosen frame(s) with a pressure test (what could be wrong?)
- ✅ Provided **concrete next steps** (tests to run, decisions to make, conversations to have)
