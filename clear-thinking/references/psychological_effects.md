# Psychological & Emotional Effects

These biases describe how we interact with objects and our own baseline levels of happiness.

|Bias or Mental Model|Notes for Better Understanding|
|---|---|
|**Endowment Effect**|Considering things to be more valuable the moment we own them.|
|**Loss Aversion**|The fear of loss weighs twice as heavily as the joy of an equivalent gain.|
|**Scarcity Error**|The belief that something is more valuable simply because it is rare or "while stocks last".|
|**Cognitive Dissonance**|Retrospectively reinterpreting failures or errors to maintain a positive self-image (the "sour grapes" effect).|
|**Effort Justification**|Overvaluing a result specifically because we put a lot of energy or pain into achieving it.|
|**Hedonic Treadmill**|The tendency to return to a baseline level of happiness shortly after a major positive gain like winning the lottery.|
|**Affect Heuristic**|Making complex decisions based on a momentary judgment of like/dislike rather than rational analysis.|
|**Contagion Bias**|The inability to ignore an emotional connection to an object, such as refusing to wear a sweater once owned by an evil person.|
