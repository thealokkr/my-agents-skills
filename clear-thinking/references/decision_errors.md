# Decision-Making & Action Fallacies

These errors impact how we invest our time and energy, often leading to wasted resources or paralysis.

|Bias or Mental Model|Notes for Better Understanding|
|---|---|
|**Sunk Cost Fallacy**|Continuing an endeavor because of past investment (money, time, love) rather than future benefit.|
|**Paradox of Choice**|Too many options lead to inner paralysis and eventual discontent with the choice made.|
|**Action Bias**|Feeling compelled to do something—anything—in an unclear situation, even if inaction would be more beneficial.|
|**Omission Bias**|Preferring inaction over action because the consequences of doing nothing seem less reprehensible than the consequences of an active error.|
|**Decision Fatigue**|The exhaustion of willpower after intensive choosing, leading to poorer subsequent decisions.|
|**Hyperbolic Discounting**|Choosing an immediate, smaller reward over a larger, future reward because "now" has a magnetic pull on our emotions.|
|**Sunk Cost/Concorde Effect**|Persisting with failing projects to "save face" rather than admitting defeat.|
|**Inability to Close Doors**|Wasting energy keeping as many options open as possible instead of focusing on a clear strategy.|
|**Planning Fallacy**|Systematically taking on too much and underestimating the time and costs of projects.|
|**Winner’s Curse**|The tendency for the winner of an auction to have overpaid because they were caught up in the competition.|
|**Procrastination**|Delaying unpleasant but important tasks because the reward is too far in the future.|
