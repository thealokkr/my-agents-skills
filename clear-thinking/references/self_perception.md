# Self-Perception & Information Biases

These errors distort how we view ourselves and the information we consume from the outside world.

|Bias or Mental Model|Notes for Better Understanding|
|---|---|
|**Confirmation Bias**|The "mother of all misconceptions"; we filter out info that contradicts our theories while embracing what confirms them.|
|**Overconfidence Effect**|The systematic overestimation of our own knowledge and ability to predict.|
|**Self-Serving Bias**|Attributing success to our own skill and failures to external factors like "the market" or bad luck.|
|**Hindsight Bias**|The "I told you so" effect; believing past events were predictable once they have already happened.|
|**Contrast Effect**|Judging something based on relative comparison rather than absolute value (e.g., buying a suit because it's "discounted").|
|**Halo Effect**|Allowing a single remarkable trait (like beauty or a high stock price) to dazzle us and color our view of the whole person or company.|
|**Introspection Illusion**|The false belief that self-reflection leads to objective truth; we trust our own soul-searching while viewing others as biased.|
|**Chauffeur Knowledge**|Confusing the "show" of knowledge with true understanding; recognizing people who have learned to put on a script without mastery.|
|**Feature-Positive Effect**|We place more emphasis on what is present than what is absent (e.g., noticing health only when it's gone).|
|**News Illusion**|News is "sugar for the mind"—sensational, irrelevant snippets that distort our mental map of risk and waste time.|
|**Cherry-Picking**|Showcasing the best results while hiding the failures, commonly seen in annual reports and hotel brochures.|
|**Twaddle Tendency**|Using reams of words to disguise intellectual laziness or a lack of clear ideas.|
