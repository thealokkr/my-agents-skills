# Social & Influence Biases

These errors stem from our evolutionary history as social animals, where group membership was essential for survival.

| Bias or Mental Model         | Notes for Better Understanding                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Social Proof**             | Also known as the **herd instinct**, this causes us to feel a behavior is correct if others are doing it.                                |
| **Reciprocity**              | We have extreme difficulty being in another's debt, which is often exploited by people who give "free" gifts to trigger a later "take". |
| **Authority Bias**           | We possess a dangerous tendency to obey experts and figures of status even when their track records are poor.                          |
| **Liking Bias**              | We are more likely to help or buy from people we find attractive, similar to us, or who flatter us.                                    |
| **Groupthink**               | Smart groups make reckless decisions because members align their opinions with a perceived consensus to avoid being the "naysayer".    |
| **Social Loafing**           | Individual performance decreases in groups because contributions become invisible and personal accountability is diffused.              |
| **Social Comparison**        | The toxic tendency to withhold help from those who might outdo us to protect our own status.                                           |
| **In-Group Out-Group**       | We identify with arbitrary groups (like sports teams) and unfairly stereotype outsiders as "different".                                |
| **False-Consensus Effect**   | We overestimate how much others share our opinions, viewing those who disagree as "abnormal".                                          |
| **Incentive Super-Response** | People do what is in their best interest according to the rewards offered, often ignoring the original intent of the system.               |
| **Motivation Crowding**      | Small monetary rewards can actually destroy intrinsic motivation or a sense of duty.                                                   |
