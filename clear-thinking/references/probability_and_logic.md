# Logic, Probability, and Risk

These errors occur because our brains are optimized for a stable, linear environment rather than a complex, modern world dominated by statistics.

| Bias or Mental Model            | Notes for Better Understanding                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Survivorship Bias**           | We overestimate the chances of success because "survivors" (rock stars, CEOs) are visible while failures are hidden in a "graveyard".        |
| **Base-Rate Neglect**           | We disregard fundamental statistical distribution (the "zebra" vs. the "horse") in favor of specific, vivid descriptions.                   |
| **Regression to Mean**          | We misinterpret natural fluctuations back toward an average (like back pain or stock performance) as the result of a specific intervention. |
| **The Black Swan**              | We fail to account for the massive impact of unthinkable, improbable events that often change everything.                                   |
| **Gambler’s Fallacy**           | The mistaken belief that independent events (like a coin toss) are interrelated and will "balance out" over time.                           |
| **Neglect of Probability**      | We respond to the magnitude of an event (the size of a jackpot) rather than the actual likelihood of it happening.                          |
| **Law of Small Numbers**        | We draw dramatic conclusions from tiny sample sizes that are statistically insignificant.                                                   |
| **Exponential Growth**          | We have no intuitive grasp for percentage growth, as our ancestors primarily encountered linear processes.                                  |
| **Induction**                   | The tendency to draw universal certainties from individual observations, which can lead to disaster when a single exception occurs.         |
| **Ambiguity Aversion**          | We favor known probabilities over unknown ones, even if the unknown option might be better.                                                 |
| **The Anchor**                  | We use a random starting point to guess an unknown value, even if that starting point is completely unrelated.                              |
| **Clustering Illusion**         | The brain’s oversensitivity to pattern recognition, causing us to see "messages" in random data.                                            |
| **False Causality**             | Mistaking correlation for causation; sometimes what we think is the cause is actually the effect.                                           |
| **Forecast Illusion**           | Experts often struggle to predict the future better than random chance, despite their confidence.                                           |
| **Illusion of Skill**           | Rewarding luck as if it were talent, especially in fields like finance where chance is the deciding factor.                                 |
| **Strategic Misrepresentation** | The systematic exaggeration of benefits and underestimation of costs to secure project approval.                                            |
