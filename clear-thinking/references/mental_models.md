# Foundational Mental Models for Thinking Clearly

These models provide a framework for approaching problems and avoiding common pitfalls.

• **Circle of Competence:** Stick to what you understand intuitively; avoid "playing games" where others have the aptitude and you do not.

• **Via Negativa:** Focus on what **not** to do. Success often comes from eliminating the downside rather than seeking the upside.

• **Hot vs. Cold Theories:** "Hot" irrationality is emotion overpowering reason; "Cold" irrationality is the thinking process itself being prone to routine error.
