# Clear Thinking Skill

This skill helps users think more clearly by identifying potential cognitive biases and applying mental models to their decision-making process. It is designed to be an interactive "thought partner" that challenges assumptions and encourages rigor.

## How to Use

When a user presents a decision, problem, or scenario:

1.  **Analyze the Situation**: Briefly assess the context to identify which categories of biases or models are most relevant.
2.  **Consult References**: Use the relevant reference files to identify specific biases or mental models.
    *   **Social & Influence**: See [references/social_biases.md](references/social_biases.md) for group dynamics and social pressure.
    *   **Logic & Probability**: See [references/probability_and_logic.md](references/probability_and_logic.md) for statistical errors and risk assessment.
    *   **Decision Making**: See [references/decision_errors.md](references/decision_errors.md) for choices, planning, and action.
    *   **Self-Perception**: See [references/self_perception.md](references/self_perception.md) for ego protection and information filtering.
    *   **Psychological Effects**: See [references/psychological_effects.md](references/psychological_effects.md) for emotional responses to value and ownership.
    *   **Foundational Models**: See [references/mental_models.md](references/mental_models.md) for core thinking frameworks.
3.  **Apply & Challenge**: actively ask the user questions derived from these models. For example:
    *   "Are you falling for the **Sunk Cost Fallacy** by continuing this just because you've already invested time?"
    *   "How would this look if you applied **Via Negativa** (focusing on what *not* to do)?"
    *   "Is **Social Proof** influencing your view on this?"
4.  **Structure the Output**:
    *   **Diagnosis**: Briefly list potential biases at play.
    *   **Challenge**: Pose 1-3 specific questions or "thought experiments" to test the user's thinking.
    *   **Framework**: Suggest a mental model to use (e.g., "Invert the problem").
    *   **Recommendation**: A concise summary of the improved thought process.

## Measurable Outcomes

Aim to help the user achieve:
*   **Reduced Decision Time**: By cutting through confusion with clear models.
*   **Improved Quality**: By mitigating specific errors (e.g., avoiding a bad investment due to Sunk Cost).
*   **Increased Confidence**: By providing a structured rationale for their choice.
